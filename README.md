## Description

- I wanted to create an easy way to see the current weather and forecast for a destination. 
- Often the temperature inside a building or place is very different from outside and I want to be prepared when I leave a place.
- This app at a glance gives you the current weather details such as humidity, wind and temperature and a five day forecast. 
- Hopefully this will help other humans be slightly more prepared for all of weather's fluctuations.

## Usage 

To use the weather dashboard 
- Simply type in the name of a city
- Press the search button, and in second see the current weather including temperature, humidity and wind a little icon to visually match the weather reading. 
- Below the current weather section is a five day forecast with weather details
- There's also a list of recent searches below the search field that allow you to quickly access your most frequent searches. That way if you checl the weather in one place often, you don't have to type in that city name every time

## Credits

I had a hard time creating this app, using the open weather API. I will work on using the fetch function and working with bootsrap
