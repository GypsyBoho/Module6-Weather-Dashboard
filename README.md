## Description

- I wanted to create a way to easily see the current weather and forcast for a destination. Often the temperature inside is very different from outside and I want to be prepared.
- This app at a glance gives you the current weather details such as humidity, wind and tempurature and gives you those same details in the forcast. 
- Also there's a function that saves recent searches so if you check the weather at home often for example you don't have to type the city name in all the time. All you need to do is find the city that you recently searched for and click the name and you'll immidately bring up the most current weather and 5 day forcast.


[Work Day Scheduler](https://gypsyboho.github.io/Module5-Scheduler/)

## Usage 

To use the work day scheduler 
- You'll notice that the current date is shown automatically at the top of the page
- Click on any time block between 9AM and 5PM and type in a note, event or other text
- Click the save button on the right-hand-side of that row. This will save your text so that it will show the next day
- If you are typing in some text that you don't use often, no need to save it, and when the page is refreshed the next day, that text will be gone, allowing you to type in new text without having to delete the previous text.
- If you want to delete text some text simply click inside the hour block and delete the text.
